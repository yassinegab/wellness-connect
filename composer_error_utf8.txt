Updating dependencies
Your requirements 
could not be 
resolved to an 
installable set of 
packages.

  Problem 1
    - 
phpunit/phpunit is 
locked to version 
11.5.51 and an 
update of this 
package was not 
requested.
    - 
phpunit/phpunit 
11.5.51 requires php 
>=8.2 -> your php 
version (8.1.25) 
does not satisfy 
that requirement.
  Problem 2
    - symfony/doctrin
e-messenger is 
locked to version 
v6.4.33 and an 
update of this 
package was not 
requested.
    - doctrine/dbal 
4.4.1 requires php 
^8.2 -> your php 
version (8.1.25) 
does not satisfy 
that requirement.
    - symfony/doctrin
e-messenger v6.4.33 
requires 
doctrine/dbal 
^2.13|^3|^4 -> 
satisfiable by 
doctrine/dbal[4.4.1].

You can also try 
re-running composer 
require with an 
explicit version 
constraint, e.g. 
"composer require sym
fony/ux-chartjs:*" 
to figure out if any 
version is 
installable, or 
"composer require sym
fony/ux-chartjs:^2.1"
 if you know which 
you need.

Installation failed, 
reverting 
./composer.json and 
./composer.lock to 
their original 
content.
